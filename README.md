# BUET-CSE-Coursework

Throughout my undergraduate journey at BUET CSE, I have worked on various projects and assignments that helped me to build a strong foundation in computer science concepts. From designing a 4-bit processor to modifying codebases like NS3 and XV6, these experiences allowed me to learn and grow significantly. This repository contains descriptions and links to all notable assignments and projects I have completed.
